# Sensor Mini Project

### Overview:

Our project takes simulated sensor data from a Websockets server and client, imports it to a text file and analyses it with Python numeric libraries and our own algorithm.


#### Task 0 
		
This task was to set up the sensor server and client for the simulated sensor to output data to the client in JSON format.
the first greeting string issued by the server to the client upon connecting is:

```sh
ECE Senior Capstone IoT simulator
```

#### Task 1

We imported data from the client in JSON format into a file data.txt using a simple for loop in our client.py file. Here's how we organized that data in our analyse.py file:

```sh
    with open(file, "r") as f:
        for line in f:
            r = json.loads(line)
            room = list(r.keys())[0]
            time = datetime.fromisoformat(r[room]["time"])

            temperature[time] = {room: r[room]["temperature"][0]}
            occupancy[time] = {room: r[room]["occupancy"][0]}
            co2[time] = {room: r[room]["co2"][0]}
         

    data = {
        "temperature": pandas.DataFrame.from_dict(temperature, "index").sort_index(),
        "occupancy": pandas.DataFrame.from_dict(occupancy, "index").sort_index(),
        "co2": pandas.DataFrame.from_dict(co2, "index").sort_index(),
    }

    return data
```

And here is the code in the client.py file that writes the data into the data.txt. Every new data point fromt the client gets imported into the data.txt file:
```sh
        for i in range(max_packets):
            data = await websocket.recv()
            if i % 5 == 0:
                pass
                # print(f"{i} total messages received")
            print(data)

            #added new code to save data into text file
            data_file=open("data.txt","a'")
            data_file.write(data+"\n")
            data_file.flush()
            data_file.close
```
#### Task 2

After getting the data together in a .txt file, we analysed the temperature, time and occupancy using the Python numeric libraries Pandas and Numpy. This is what our code returned for median and variance of the temperature and occupancy data:


```sh
median of temperature in lab1 is: 21.026 

variance of temperature in lab1 is: 1.4438 

median of occupancy in lab1 is: 5.0 

variance of occupancy in lab1 is: 4.0798 
```

After calulating these statistics, we plotted probability density functions for each data type:

Here is the mean and variance of the time intravals:

```sh
the mean of time interval for sensor is: 1026.2ms

the variance of time interval is sensor is: 9.9794e+05
```

The interval time plot looks like a normal distribution as the majority of data points concentrate around the mean(1026ms) and the rest are somewhat evenly distributed around the mean. Even it seems to have some negative time interval on the plot, the plot is accurate. It actually happens because the x axis scale (time in ms) is too large for the data points to plot on.

#### Task 3

To detect outliers in the temperature sensor data, we created an algorithm. There were no data points greater than 2 standard deviations away from the mean, so we considered everything outside of one standard deviation to be an outlier. Here is what our code returned for the percentage of bad data points and the new median and varience without them:

```sh
Considering the data point ONE standard away mean as bad data point, then:
the percentage of bad lab1 temperature data points: 0.05

after removing the abnormal (1 standard deviation away mean), the median is: 21.022
 
after removing the abnormal (1 standard deviation away mean), the variance is: 0.059677
```
The persistent temperature change may not be from a failed sensor. In reality, it changes over time naturally (such as day time is warmer than night time), However for the simulated data, we are not sure how it is simulated, so we can assume that the temperature changes persistently in certain ranges, which is normal.


Based on the possible standard deviations, we calculated the possible temperature bounds for each room:

```sh
according to the data point collected and considering temperature in 3 standard deviation away the mean are possible, then:
the possible bounds on temperature for lab1 is from 17.5799 to 24.7894

the possible bounds on temperature for office is from 18.0107 to 28.7376

the possible bounds on temperature for class1 is from 24.5638 to 29.7993

for lab1, if removed the abnormal temperature(1 standard deviation away mean), the possible of temperature is from 20.2994 to 21.7651
```
#### Task 4

The simulation reflects real world variables that contribute to room temperatures like occupancy and CO2 levels, however it fails to account for what else is going on in a room, such as a/c units, open/closed windows, seasonal time of year, etc. For the most accurate information with a real world sensor, the server should poll the sensors so everything can be checked if the data does not seem accurate. For this server, the Python websockets library was easy to use relative to a compiled language.
